# Advent of Code 2025

This repository contains my solutions for the [Advent of Code 2025](https://adventofcode.com/2025) challenges.

## Structure

The project is organized by year and day:

```
2025/
  day1/
    solution.py
    puzzleinput.md
  day2/
    ...
```

## Running Solutions

To run a specific day's solution, execute the python script directly. For example, for Day 3 of 2025:

```bash
uv run python3 2025/day3/solution.py
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.13+
- `uv` for dependency management (optional but recommended)
